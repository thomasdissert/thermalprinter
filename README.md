# Thermalprinter

This is a quickly hacked project to help a friend with a design installation for his master's studies

## Setup

The setup is done using `python` with `flask` for a webserver and `python-escpos` for communicating with a thermal printer

The webserver provides a simple file upload form and a backend-route doing the actual communication with the printer.
